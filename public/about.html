						This is a read through the Bible in a year program based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.navigators.org/Tools/Bible%20Study%20Resources/Tools/The%20Bible%20Reading%20Plans">Discipleship Journal Reading Plan</a>.
						Each day has 4 readings, each from a different section of the Bible (Old Testament, New Testament, Gospel, and Wisdom). At the end of the four readings there's a button to mark that day's reading done, and when you refresh the page or return to the page tomorrow it'll show you the next day's reading.
						Each month has 25 readings so there are built into the schedule skip/miss days.
					</p>

					<!-- <ul>
						<li>By reading from four separate places in the Scripture every day, you should be able to better grasp the unity of the Scriptures, as well as enjoy the variety of seeing four different viewpoints. You can begin at any point of the year.</li>
						<li>To prevent the frustration of falling behind, which most of us tend to do when following a Bible reading plan, each month of this plan gives you only twenty-five readings. Since you'll have several "free days" each month, you could set aside Sundays to either not read at all or to catch up on any readings you may have missed in the past week.</li>
						<li>If you finish the month's readings by the twenty-fifth, you could use the final days of the month to study the passages that challenged or intrigued you.</li>
						<li>If reading through the entire Bible in one year looms as too large a task, you can alter the plan to meet your needs. For example, you could read the gospels and the wisdom books this year, and the other two categories next year.</li>
					</ul> -->

					<p>One of the goals of this project is to allow for a mobile friendly way of letting you read, when you don't have your Bible in-hand.</p>

					<p>At the bottom of the page the current weekly <a target="_blank" href="http://fighterverses.com/">Fighter Verse</a> is presented for memorization.</p>

					<p>To avoid making you sign up, and to stay out of the way as much as possible, this app simply keeps track of your next reading by means of a cookie. It **ONLY** marks the month and day of the reading that you last read.</p>
